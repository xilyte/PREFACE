## Vision
To enable any end user to securely delegate excess cryptocurrency to a contingent `Store of Value` (SoV) while the underlier being a **Asset-backed** utility token simultaneously interoperable on multiple top-of-the-stack, State-of-the-Art blockchain protocols.

## Mission
To secure `hardened` **Worth** and propell adoption of *intangibles* over distributed parallel servers.
Integral to the Vision realization is the setting that allowe for any person (alive) to act as a *local* bank equivalent, authorized to charge and disburse `xilyte` upon their own discretion and regulation.

### Time-track:
#### Token creation
To be performed on the daybreak of Genesis.
#### /BEG Token Sale (Universal)
To be performed 666,666 seconds after Genesis.
#### /END Token Sale (Public)
Ends at 6,666,666 seconds post Genesis.
#### Manual OTC sales (Incl. physical swaps)
Ends within 66,666,666 seconds after Genesis.

### InflatEON
All and any wallet is entitled to InflatEON for possessing (provable) xilyte.
#### Periodical timeframe
Each discreet **InflatEON** runs every `2**31 ms` or at roughly 21 days.
#### Rationalization
Every ro of tithe disimburses pro rata to RMP incremental deflation of *seked*.
##### Explanation
As the sequence (commencing at `null`) is to be bumped every 2.147 million seconds, the portion of allotment from the **Source** shall be minimized gradually.
This is precisely achieved by giving up float-point precision in lieu of whole-unit fractions.
